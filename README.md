# RRT_star

Here, we write a code to implement RRT^* algorithm. 
This code is mainly adopted from

https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/60993-2d-3d-rrt-algorithm

which is the Matlab implementation of RRT-star algorithm.

RRT-star is a sampling based algorithm proposed to explore the space. The advantage of this algorithm is that it works for continuous spaces.
