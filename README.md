# RRT_star

RRT_star is a sampling based motion planning. This algorithm works for the continuous spaces. The details of algorithm can be found here

In this repository, we write a Python code to implement RRT^* algorithm. The implementation is mainly based on 

https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/60993-2d-3d-rrt-algorithm

which is a Matlab implementation of the RRT-star algorithm.
